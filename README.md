# This is a rehost of ClickmonitorDDC.

The official website has disappeared from the public web and I'm unable to reach the original developer Martin. So I've decided, in accordance with the developers copyright notice, to rehost the builds of ClickmonitorDDC here.

- The archived version of the original website can be found in the web archive [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016064411/https://clickmonitorddc.bplaced.net/)
- Full instructions for 7.2 are rehosted in the [ClickMonitorDDC7.2](https://github.com/chrismah/ClickMonitorDDC7.2) repo
- Command line arguments are explained in the [ClickMonitorDDC-Command-Line](https://github.com/keipes/ClickMonitorDDC-Command-Line) github repo 
- [another](https://github.com/graealex/ClickMonitorDDC) repo that hosts 7.2

If anyone knows how to reach the developer of this tool or has the sourcecode please get in touch.
